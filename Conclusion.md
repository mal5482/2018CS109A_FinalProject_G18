# Conclusion

Our study showed the possibility of using baseline predictors to predict the baseline diagnosis status. All prediction models achieves a test accuracy higher than 87%, with six of them higher than 90% and two higher than 96%, except for k-NN. Performance of models on each diagnosis status remains high.

There are interesing findings in terms of important predictors. Our study identified CDRSB_bl, MMSE_bl, RAVLT_immediate_bl, and ADAS13_bl four important feature in classification of cognitive normal (CN), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD). These predictors are all from neurocognitive/neuropsychological assessments and are easily accessible for everyone. The demonstration of their contribution in prediction suggests the possibility to use these neurocognitive/neuropsychological questionnaires to do self-assessment of AD at home.

Becasue of the limited scope of this project, there are many things left to be discovered in the future on this topic, including but not limited to: the importance of predictor in domains other than neurocognitive/neuropsychological assessments; prediction for multiple and longer phases within the same individuals; larger and more comprehensive dataset; more classification models, etc.
